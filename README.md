#### About 
Student centered learning and the creation of student centered spaces online are gaining credence in educational settings. We know that effective learning requires access to social and academic networks for both study material and emotional support; as such, online communities can offer a holistic knowledge construction, support mechanism, and recognize that affective activity is effective.
Student Forums provide students to come together and discuss unlimited topics, including social activities and educational ideas. They are supportive spaces for students, most successful with large first and second year courses where students would not otherwise have the opportunity to communicate with others outside their own tutorial group.
We have used the concepts learnt in our Web Technologies course and made a basic client server application that helps us post about various topics of learning.
